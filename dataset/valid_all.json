You have perfect weather, and you get to watch all the leaves change colors.

My home overlooks a canyon, and my favorite trail runs through it. When it's too cold for hiking I really love to just sit and look out the window, enjoy a nice fire, and crochet some.

What types of grains do you use for your brew? \nbot:I prefer toasted malt, but I really love a good bitter ipa\nuser:Fancy! IPAs are yummy. I've had a few different kinds, but never a home brewed version.

Most of my friends have moved to bigger cities.

Are there special trains for that or do they just add the plow to the front of a train on the tracks?\nbot:One of the first, and most common types of railroad snow plows used was the wedge plow. As its name implies the wedge plow used a simple wedged design, in later years made from reinforced iron or steel. The railroad snow plow itself was usually attached to the front of either a customized rail car of some type with a pilot house attached to the top for the spotting crew. One of the most common types of wedge plows were those built by the Russell Snow Plow Company, which began manufacturing the machines after World War I. Developed with a bit of versatility, Russells were equipped with wings attached to the outside of what was known as the tongue (the wedge device that actually plowed the snow clear of the track), which could be adjusted. All wedge plows could not propel themselves and required being pushed by a locomotive.\nuser:Wow that's very interesting!

        "context": "bot:Hello, welcome to Alexa social bot. What do you want to chat?\nuser:I have been working on new styles for my 11 year old daughter's hair. It is so fine and hard to keep smooth. What new hairstyle should I try for her tomorrow for school?\nbot:For fine hair that's hard to control, short hairstyles are recommended. The secret is finding the right balance, You need to weight the amount of time and effort you want to give to the hair with the effectiveness of the results.\nuser:That is a good idea. My problem is that she wants to keep her long hair. She loves the let if fly when she runs but it gets it so tangled. I need something that will be easy to do with her fine hair but keep it under control. What else can I do with long fine hair besides braids?\nbot:Using highlights can provide a nice sense of contrast to fine hair, giving it a fuller look and adding a sense of greater body. Given that you want to avoid braids, maybe a half-braid updo would work. It's a way of having the best of both worlds without committing entirely to braids.\nuser:I might try that. Thanks. She might be more willing if there was some of her hair flying free. With my hair, it is long and thick. I usually resort to pony tails because I am in a hurry. What suggestions do you have to quickly style long thick hair?\nbot:For quick hairstyling when your hair is long and thick, consider a middle part with wavy curls. A loose curl helps frame many faces well. You also might try a loose bun, which creates a polished but casual look without an excess amount of effort.\nuser:I like the loose bun idea but am excited about curls. My hair is kind of wavy but does not really create great curls. Is there a way to help bring out the curls in my hair?\nbot:A small amount of styling gel can define curls in wavy hair without drying it out or making it overly stiff. Brush your hair with a wide-tooth comb to separate the strands and dry it with a microfiber cloth. Then use a diffuser to play down the waves and make the curls more prominent.\nuser:I've tried that but I often find myself in too much of a rush in the morning. I would love to find a way to get my hair to just curl more naturally, like maybe go to sleep and wake up with it curly. Until the Jetson hair helmet is a thing, I may just be stuck.\nbot:You might want to try the classic curl technique. Wrap the hair flat around your curling iron barrel (one inch), with no spaces between the wrapped strands. Curl it for no more than 10 or 15 seconds, then let it go into your palm to set for several seconds. This may help create those curls more easily.\nuser:Thanks. It seems as if everyone either wants their hair to be curlier or straighter but never really happy with what we have. I just tried some semi-permanent hair dye last month. It was fun but I did not like the way it looked a few days later. I wonder if I picked a good brand? What kind of semi-permanent dye would you recommend?\n",

It was always so smart and clever and she always took it in stride.\nbot:What do you think Tina Fey's best line in the series is?  The one where she says she can't wear green because she has witch undertones\" is probably the one that makes me laugh the most!\nuser:I actually think they gave other character's the best lines. My favorite was when Jack says to Liz \"Never follow a hippie to a second location.\"\nbot:That's a good one!  If you could write one line for Tina Fey in 30 Rock, what would you have her say?\nuser:Hmmm.... that's a tough one! Probably I would say something to Tracy about his love life. \nbot:That sounds like it would be pretty funny!  What is it about Tracy's love life that you think would make the funniest joke?\nuser:I don't know - I'm not a great sketch writer, but he has a reputation for \"womanizing\" so I would likely write something referencing that.\nbot:Liz's love advice usually turns out to be a disaster, so I can see how tackling Tracy's womanizing would make for great comedy.  Her delivery is what I think really makes her character work - what do you like best about her?\nuser:I really like that she is smart and dedicated and really cares about the people that work there. She always tries to please everyone and she's very selfless.\nbot:True, those are some of her best qualities.  Her scenes with Dennis really show how the two characters are such a contrast.\nuser:Yes, there are so many selfish, self absorbed characters (Jenna) around her, and she really works hard to make everyone happy all at the same time. She's kind of like a mom to the whole group.\n",

North Face is frequently in the top 10 of the best fleece jackets.\nuser:How about Mountain Hardware? I had a fleece jacket from them I loved. Are they still around?\nbot:I never hear of this jacket brand. I never seen it in the top 10.\nuser:They may not be in the top ten at the moment. Or it may depend on the  top ten you look at, but they make good stuff. What are the best coats from the North Face?\nbot:I like a lot the Carto Triclimate Jacket. It is the best. And you, do you have a favorite jacket from Mountain Hardware?\nuser:The Ascent is a good one. Lite though. How much is the North Face Carto?\nbot:I don't remember the exact price but it is an expensive jacket.\nuser:Do you know of any lower cost options?\nbot:There is a jacket made by Nautice that I saw at Macy the other day. It is not expensive.\nuser:What was it made of? Was it comparable to the North Face coat? \nbot:I don't remember what is made of but I know it was waterprof and insulated. For sure, the North Face is better. They are not comparable.\nuser:Bummer. Finding one at a good price would be nice. Now that I'm thinking about it I need a new rain coat too.\nbot:If you are looking for a raining coat, you should consider also North Face. North Face is always in the top 5 in any kind of jacket/coat but it is expensive.\nuser:What else is out there at a reasonable cost?\n",

And she also fell for Prince Philip when she was just 13.\nuser:It is amazing that she has been in love with him for over 80 years.\nbot:There are rumours, unfortunately, that Prince Philip wasn't loyal to Queen Elizabeth. When she was 8 months pregnant, he was allegedly fooling around with Pat Kirkwood, a 27 year old showgirl\nuser:That is so sad.  The Crown does touch on his infidelity.  Before I saw the show, I didn't know that there were any rifts in their marriage.\nbot:It is sad, but she did describe him as \"my strength and stay all these years\". So even if he has been unfaithful, she still loves him so much.\nuser:When I met them, they did seem to take a lot of strength from each other.\nbot:Where did you meet her? She has visited the Royal Air Force Marham and the Wolferton Pumping Station, amongst many other places\nuser:I was invited to meet her after I saved a child from a well.\nbot:That's so interesting! So you were like Lassie? The dog that saved Timmy in a well\nuser:Kind of!  I noticed a child fall into a well.  I helped her get into a bucket and get out so she did not drown or die.

Even being off by as much as a centimer can mean drivnig it dead center down the fairway or straight into the water hazard lol. But at the end of the day one of the most important things to remember is that this is supposed to de-stress you. I mean you're typically in the middle of a beautiful green field enjoying the elements, and removed from technology. How you approach golf should be how you approach life. Do you best, try to adjust the little things, and don't get too upset if things don't go your way.\nbot:Is there any gold course you have played that you have not enjoyed? \nuser:I'm not a big fan, in general, of the European golf courses.

I am still no expert though.\nuser:I know that you can find a lot of google and even get some good training videos on youtube but I guess I'm old school. I like having an instructor behind me going over every facet of my swing. Even a little thing like mentally thinking to yourself to drop your shoulders has made such a difference and I would have never had figured it out on Youtube. Look at the resume of the pros that the golf club has, interview them for like 5 minutes, pick out the one you like and have them give you a critique and you can decide from there if that pro is for you.\n",
