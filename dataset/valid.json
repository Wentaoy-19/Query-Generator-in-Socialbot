Are there special trains for that or do they just add the plow to the front of a train on the tracks?\nbot:One of the first, and most common types of railroad snow plows used was the wedge plow. As its name implies the wedge plow used a simple wedged design, in later years made from reinforced iron or steel. The railroad snow plow itself was usually attached to the front of either a customized rail car of some type with a pilot house attached to the top for the spotting crew. One of the most common types of wedge plows were those built by the Russell Snow Plow Company, which began manufacturing the machines after World War I. Developed with a bit of versatility, Russells were equipped with wings attached to the outside of what was known as the tongue (the wedge device that actually plowed the snow clear of the track), which could be adjusted. All wedge plows could not propel themselves and required being pushed by a locomotive.\nuser:Wow that's very interesting!

It's one of my favorite dishes to search Boston for before the big hockey game. Something about cheering for the Bruins always makes me so hungry.\nbot:Bruins is one of the best teams, having won 6 championships, they have a solid foundation. would be amazing is Ray Bourque was still young enough to play with the Bruins, Bruins would dominate.\nuser:Ray was a beast, but since he was on the rooster, there have been some amazing players. My favorites are Patrice Bergeron and Zdeno Chara.\nbot:dont forget about Cam Neely and Phil Esposito!

It really gets me motivated and excited to get things done.\nbot:That's great. I see your favorite band is Metallica. Did you ever listen to Pantera as well?\nuser:Yes, Pantera is awesome! I've only seen them live twice at Ozzfest. They put on a great show. Have you ever seen them live?\nbot:Only once, but it was an amazing experience! I saw them at the Cat Club in New York back in '89. Unforgettable. What's the best metal concert you've ever been to?\nuser:definitely the Metallica show in 94'. I saw them in Mountain View, and it was by far the best show. They had tons of pyro and did a 45 minute encore! Do you listen to any other metal bands\nbot:That sounds insane, I love it when a band adds a good pyro show! I like Deftones and Machine Head, what other bands do you like?\nuser:Deftones are really good, but they went downhill after White Pony imo. I think Gojira and mastodon are good for newer metal, oh and I've been really into Messhuga lately too.\nbot:Agreed, I only listen to older Deftones stuff. I've never heard much Gojira but I like Meshuggah, especially 'Nothing' from 2002. \nuser:That's a good one! I love the crazy drums and fun jazz notes. It's always cool when a band can take other genres and weave them into metal. I can't wait to see whose going to be play at sxsw this year.

SXSW is always a really good time, but I love Ozzfest! It will always be the best in my eyes. I get to congregate with all the crazy metal heads like me.

He plays all aspects, passing, defending, rebounding.  If LeBron played in Jordan's era, he would be twice as dominant as he is now.

Even a little thing like mentally thinking to yourself to drop your shoulders has made such a difference and I would have never had figured it out on Youtube.
